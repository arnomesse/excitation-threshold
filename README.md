# Excitable Dynamics Simplify Neural Connectomes

![Sketch](sketch.png)

# Description

Minimal code to reproduce the main findings of Mess√© et al. (2025) Excitable Dynamics Simplify Neural Connectomes.
We show how excitable dynamics simplify network representation by making weighted and binary networks dynamically equivalent for an appropriate network threshold.
